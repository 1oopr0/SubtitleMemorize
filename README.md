Introduction
============

`SubtitleMemorize` is a tool that generates a list of images, audio files, lines and
translations of these lines by using video and subtitle files.
This is especially useful for language learning, as the resulting files can be imported into
spaced repetition software
like [Anki](http://ankisrs.net/ "Link to Anki homepage"). To make it even more effective, all generated cards can be used directly in the Anki plugin [MorphMan](https://github.com/ChangSpivey/MorphMan), which sorts the massive amounts of cards based on the cards difficulty and the words you know.

This tool currently only runs on Linux, but is deliberately built solely on top of portable technologies.

Tutorial
============
See the official [SubtitleMemorize wiki](https://github.com/ChangSpivey/SubtitleMemorize/wiki) for information on installation, usage and more!

Status
============
This software has been successfully used to create multiple high-quality Anki decks. Because it is still in beta, some rough edges and unfinished features are nonetheless remaining. Any help, especially on documentation, would be greatly appreciated!
