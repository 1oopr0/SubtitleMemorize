Introduction
============

`SubtitleMemorize` is a tool that generates a list of images, audio files, lines and
translations of these lines by using video and subtitle files.
This is especially useful for language learning, as the resulting files can be imported into
[spaced repetition software](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spaced_repetition "Link to Wikipedia")
like [Anki](http://ankisrs.net/ "Link to Anki homepage").

This tool currently only runs on Linux and is a similar to
[subs2srs](http://subs2srs.sourceforge.net/), which is Windows-only. These two projects
share some code, but otherwise they are independent.
